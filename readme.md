## Stochastic Processes 

This course provides an introduction to stochastic processes, with an emphasis on regenerative phenomena. Topics cover generating functions, conditional probability distributions and conditional expectation, discrete-time Markov chains with a countable state space, limit distributions for ergodic and absorbing chains, applications including the random walk, the gambler's ruin problem, and the Galton-Watson branching process, an introduction to counting processes, connections between the exponential distribution and Poisson process, and non-homogeneous and compound Poisson processes.
